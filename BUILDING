NOTE: Only macOS is currently supported.  If support for linux or
Windows is added, these instructions will apply

Linux or macOS
===============
Building this Tk extension requires autoconf.
The steps are:

1. Edit configure.ac to set the Clipssh version number.  The line which must
be changed looks like:

AC_INIT([Clipssh],[0.0.1])

2. Run autoconf.

3. Export a CFLAGS variable, e.g.

export CFLAGS="-arch arm64 -arch x86_64 -mmacosx-version-min=10.13"

4. Run the configure script.  You must specify the locations of the Tcl
and Tk source directories using the options -with-tcl and -with-tk. The
directories specified with those options must contain the scripts
TclConfig.sh and TkConfig.sh respectively.  For example:

./configure --with-tcl=$HOME/TclTk/tcl8.6/unix -with-tk=$HOME/TclTk/tk8.6/unix

Windows
=======

1. Edit configure.ac as for the linux and macOS systems.  The nmake build
system will extract the TkGL version number from that file.

2. Run nmake in an appropriate MSVC build environment, such as one of the
"command prompts" provided with VisualStudio.  For example:

> cd win
> nmake TCLDIR=C:\TclTkSrc\tcl8.6 TKDIR=C:\TclTkSrc\tk8.6 -f makefile.vc

The compiled Tk extension will be found in win/Release*
